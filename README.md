# Autocomplete

We will build an autocomplet plugin by implementing a trie.

# Implement

Implement the following methods in `Trie`:

`_includes(substring, node)` returns true if the given substring is in the trie starting from the given `node`. Otherwise, returns false.

`iterate(node)` returns all the strings that can be built from this node.

# Run

Open `index.html` to run the autocomplet plugin.

# Tests

Run tests by opening `SpecRunner.html`.
